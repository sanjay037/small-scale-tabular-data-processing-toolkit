#Each dataset has a M Ã— N matrix, where M is the number of records/instances, and N is the number of numerical variables. Each #row in an excel sheet corresponds to a record, and each column to a variable.

#This project contains several tasks.Each task will be in the model of finding covariance Matrix,Eigen values,Reverse 
#Cuthill-Mckee reordering,Robinsonian Reordering.

#Output will be a M x N matrix from each task.
